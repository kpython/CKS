**Some tips**
- Be fast, be fast, and be fast. ;)
- Master Vim to be as fast as possible.
- The documentation is only here to copy-paste code snippets that you already know where to find. However, during the exam, there isn’t enough time to search for information you don’t know or have never tested before.  
  If you really don’t know something, don’t waste time searching.
- Experiment and train as much as possible with Killercoda and Killershell.

**Important before taking the exam:**
- Be 100% sure your connection is fast and stable (check ping delay).
- Read: https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/important-instructions-cks
- Make sure you know how to copy-paste in the PSI Exam testing environment.  
  For macOS: Copy/Paste: `shift + ctrl + c / v`
- Verify your webcam is able to autofocus (ID check during the admission process).
- (For macOS) Make sure none of these processes are running on your Mac before starting the exam and get rid of them.  
  Tip: Shut down any Apple device (iPhone and iPad) or turn off Bluetooth:
